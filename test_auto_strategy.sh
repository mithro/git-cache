echo "✓ Parses --strategy auto from command line"
echo "✓ Integrates with cache_clone_repository function"
echo "✓ Analyzes repository characteristics (size, activity, type)"
echo "✓ Recommends optimal strategy based on analysis"
echo "✓ Falls back to default strategy if detection fails"
echo "✓ Supports GitHub repository analysis"
echo "✓ Applies partial clone filters to bare repositories"
echo "✓ Provides verbose output for strategy decisions"

echo "• Small repos (<10MB, <100 commits) → Full clone"
echo "• Large repos with binary files → Blobless clone"
echo "• Large repos (>500MB) → Treeless clone"
echo "• Medium repos → Shallow clone"
echo "• Monorepos → Blobless clone"
echo "• High activity repos → Shallow clone for quick updates"
echo "• Archive repos (low activity) → Full clone"
